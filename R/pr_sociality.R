#' @title Computes the proportion of time spent with at least one conspecific
#'
#'
#' @description The function computes, for every individual, the proportion of time it has been read in presence of at least
#' one conspecific (read at the same second at the same antenna).
#'
#'
#' @param block_df A data frame containing the reads from an experimental block
#'
#' @param block_ref_df A data frame containing a reference list with all individuals present in the experimental block.
#'
#' @param cutoff A value corresponding to the minimum number of \emph{total reads} (both accompanied and non-accompanied) from which a
#' sociability index (\emph{i.e.} proportion of accompanied reads) should be computed. For example, if an individual has been
#' read only once, by chance, in presence of a conspecific, a score of 100\% for this individual is likely non-representative of the
#' real proportion of time it spends in presence of conspecifics By default, the value if set at 10 total reads. For no cutoff, one can
#' use a value of 0.
#'
#' @return A data table containing (i) the number of accompanied reads (\emph{i.e.} reads for which at least
#' another individual was present at the same antenna and at the same second); (ii) total number of reads;
#' (iii) proportion of accompanied reads (\code{proportion} = \code{acc_reads} / \code{tot_reads}).
