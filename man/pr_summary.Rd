\title{Produces a summary table and a heatmap}
\usage{
pr_summary(block_df, block_ref_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{block_df}{A data frame containing the reads from an experimental block}

\item{block_ref_df}{A data frame containing a reference list with all individuals present in the experimental block.}
}
\value{
A summary table containing the number of reads of each individual (per antenna, and total reads),
and its visual representation as a heatmap.
}
\description{
This function takes the reads from an experimental block (\code{block_df}) and a
reference list of fish present in this block (\code{block_ref_df}).
It produces (i) a summary table containing the reads of each individual per antenna, and the total reads;
(ii) a heatmap corresponding to a visual representation of the table.

Why do we need both \code{block_df} and \code{block_ref_df}? If all the individuals have been read in \code{block_df},
then the individuals present in \code{block_ref_df} and \code{block_df} are the same.
However, if some individuals haven't been read in \code{block_df} (e.g. animals haven't moved, lost the tag, are dead),
then there will be more individuals in the \code{block_ref_df}.

# Inputs
# block_7_df <- read.csv("~/block_7_df.txt", sep="")
# ind_block_7 <- data.frame(id = c("0007E50321", "0007A34978", "0007DF1B76"))

# Run the function
# pr_summary(block_df = block_7_df, ind_block_7)
